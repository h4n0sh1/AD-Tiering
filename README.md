## Introduction

This repo means to provide minimalistic yet efficient utilities to help security teams save time in their journey of hardening existing Active Directory infrastructures.<br>
The philosophy is to make as few assumptions as possible about the way each organization wants to implement it's tiering architecture, hence the choice of an XML based declaration. 

## Features 

- Exporting and replicating an Active Directory Tree to / from a CSV file
- Creating new Tiering Organizational Unit from an XML file declaration
- Replicating Active Directory Tree structure under the newly created Tiering Organizational Unit
- Linking existing GPO

## Usage 

These tools have been developped with minimal impact in mind, as we do measure the intrisical risk associated with these highly sensitive environments. This means that a typical workflow would encapsulate the following : 

| Script              | Purpose                                   | Recommended Environment |
| --------------------| ------------------------------------------|-------------------------| 
| Exports-ADTree.ps1  | Exports all AD Tree objects in CSV format | RSAT, RODC              |
| Export-GPOLinks.ps1 | Exports all GPO Links in CSV format       | RSAT, RODC              |
| Copy-ADTree.ps1     | Replicates AD Tree objects from CSV file  | Virtual Machine / Test  |
| New-TieringOU.ps1   | Creates Tiering OUs based on XML template | Virtual Machine / Test  |
| Populate-TieringOU.ps1 | Replicates AD Ous under Tiering OUs    | Virtual Machine / Test  |
| Copy-GPOLinks.ps1 Â  | Replicates GPO Links under Tiering OUs    | Virtual Machine / Test  |

## Requirements

None aside from a running version of Windows Server 2019+. <br>
Further tests required to assess backwards compatibility.
